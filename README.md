Unix scripts

BACKUP
========
required mailx
the ability to use tar

Backup is a script to be executed on a unix server.
Run this script anywhere it will create a tar file called home followed by the date. 
It will prompt you for an email address to send it to. 

CONEDIT
========

This was a script for my unix class.
Just something that I thought I should enclude on here.
